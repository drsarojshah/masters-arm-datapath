Master's Project: "Modeling the Execution Engine (Datapath) Portion of an ARM Processor"

üìÖ **Degree**: M.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering  
üè´ **Institution**: University at Albany, SUNY  
üë®‚Äçüè´ **Advisor**: Professor James R. Moulic  
üéØ **Goal**: Simulate a simplified LEGv8 5-stage pipelined processor and convert the model into synthesizable VHDL

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Description

This project models and simulates a simplified ARMv8-style processor using a subset of the LEGv8 instruction set. The design focuses on the **execution engine (datapath)**, which consists of:

- Instruction Fetch (IF)
- Instruction Decode (ID)
- Operand Fetch (OF)
- Execute (EX)
- Write Back (WB)

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Used

- **C Programming** ‚Äî simulation of the pipeline  
- **Vitis HLS** ‚Äî synthesis of C into VHDL  
- **Vivado** ‚Äî RTL simulation and waveform analysis  
- **LEGv8 ISA** ‚Äî instruction set architecture modeled after ARMv8  

---

## üíª Features Implemented

- Simulated instructions: `ADD`, `SUB`, `ADDI`, `SUBI`, `AND`, `ORR`, `LDUR`, `STUR`  
- Register file and main memory modeled as 2D arrays  
- Opcode decoding and operand extraction  
- Testbench for waveform analysis using Vivado

## üß™ Simulation Results

- ‚úÖ Verified 5-stage execution of each instruction  
- ‚úÖ Correct memory and register interactions  
- ‚úÖ RTL waveforms confirm proper operation (see screenshot)
